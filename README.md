This article extends the classic pursuit problem from Prof. H.C. Vermaâ€™s Concepts of Physics Vol 1, where three particles move towards each other from the vertices of an equilateral triangle with uniform velocity. By expanding this to include a square, a regular pentagon, and a regular hexagon, and employing Python simulations to visualize their paths, this study explores the impact of uniform acceleration on their trajectories, offering a deeper understanding of kinematic behaviors. This comprehensive analysis aims to engage high school and undergraduate students with a fascinating exploration of classical mechanics.
